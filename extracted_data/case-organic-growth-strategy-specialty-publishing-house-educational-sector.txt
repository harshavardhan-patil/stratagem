Internal Assessment

The organization boasts a strong reputation for quality educational materials but struggles with adapting its product offerings to the digital age.
Strengths include a well-established brand and a loyal customer base in the educational sector. Opportunities lie in expanding into digital formats and leveraging technology to offer personalized learning experiences.

Digital Product Innovation

The team decided to apply the Blue Ocean Strategy and the Ansoff Matrix to guide the Digital Product Innovation initiative. The Blue Ocean Strategy, a concept developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, focuses on creating new market spaces or "blue oceans" that are untapped by competitors. This framework was instrumental in identifying opportunities for innovative digital learning platforms that could differentiate the publishing house in the educational sector. Following this strategic direction, the team undertook several steps:
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the current educational publishing market to identify oversaturated areas and potential "blue oceans."
- Engaged with educators and learners to uncover unmet needs and preferences that could be addressed through innovative digital products.
- Developed prototype digital learning platforms and tested them with a select group of educators and students to refine the offerings.

This framework was pivotal in transforming the content development process through the following actions:
- Organizing the content development team into small, cross-functional Scrum teams focused on specific digital product developments.
- Implementing sprints, short, time-boxed periods where a set amount of work must be completed, to increase productivity and accelerate time-to-market.
- Facilitating regular Scrum meetings to assess progress, address challenges, and adapt plans as needed to ensure alignment with strategic objectives.
