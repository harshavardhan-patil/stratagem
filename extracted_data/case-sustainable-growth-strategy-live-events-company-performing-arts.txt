Implement an Integrated Enterprise Asset Management System

The strategic initiative to implement an integrated Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) system was guided by the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the organization and the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). The RBV framework was instrumental in identifying the unique resources and capabilities that could provide the company with a competitive advantage through enhanced asset management. It was determined that the efficient management of the company's assets was a critical resource that needed to be developed and leveraged. Following this realization, the team took several steps:
- Conducted an internal audit to identify and categorize all physical and digital assets, assessing their current utilization and contribution to competitive advantage.
- Evaluated the existing asset management processes to identify gaps and areas for improvement, aligning them with best practices identified through RBV.

Sustainability in Operations

To address the strategic initiative of integrating sustainability into operations, the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework and the Theory of Constraints (TOC) were applied. The TBL framework was chosen for its comprehensive approach to measuring organizational success on three fronts: environmental, social, and financial. This guided the company in aligning its sustainability goals with its overall business objectives. The steps taken included:
- Identifying key performance indicators for each of the TBL dimensions that were relevant to the company's operations.
- Integrating these indicators into the company's reporting and decision-making processes to ensure balanced consideration of economic, environmental, and social factors.
