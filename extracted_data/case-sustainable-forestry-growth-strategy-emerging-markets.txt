Source: https://flevy.com/topic/emerging-market-entry/case-sustainable-forestry-growth-strategy-emerging-markets




Consider this scenario: A leading sustainable forestry company, operating primarily in established markets, faces the strategic challenge of emerging market entry.
The organization confronts a 20% decline in market share due to aggressive competition and a 15% cost increase from supply chain inefficiencies. The primary strategic objective is to penetrate emerging markets, leveraging sustainable practices to gain a competitive advantage and secure long-term growth.
The organization has been successful in maintaining sustainable forestry practices in established markets but now finds its growth stagnating amidst rising competition and operational costs. It appears that the company's traditional market strategies and operational frameworks are ill-suited for the dynamics of emerging markets. The necessity to innovate its business model and streamline its supply chain becomes evident for sustaining growth and competitiveness.

Emerging Market Entry

The organization utilized the Market-Based View (MBV) of strategy to guide its entry into emerging markets. The MBV framework, which focuses on the importance of external market conditions in formulating strategy, was instrumental in identifying attractive markets and positioning the company's sustainable forestry products. This approach was chosen because it emphasizes understanding the competitive environment and leveraging the organization's external opportunities. The team meticulously:
- Conducted comprehensive market analysis to identify emerging markets with high demand for sustainable products and low competitive intensity.
- Assessed the competitive landscape in these markets to determine the optimal market entry strategy, such as partnerships, joint ventures, or direct investment.
- Developed positioning strategies that highlighted the unique value proposition of the company's sustainable forestry practices to differentiate from local competitors.

Additionally, the Resource-Based View (RBV) framework was employed to align the company’s internal capabilities with the identified market opportunities. The RBV framework suggests that competitive advantage is achieved by leveraging a firm's unique resources and capabilities. This perspective was critical for the organization to match its strengths with the opportunities identified through the MBV analysis. The process included:
- Evaluating the company’s unique resources, such as sustainable forestry practices and green certifications, that could be leveraged in emerging markets.
- Identifying capability gaps that needed to be addressed to successfully enter and compete in these new markets.
- Developing a strategic plan to enhance these capabilities, including technology transfer, training for local employees, and establishing local supply chains.

Digital Transformation of the Supply Chain

For the digital transformation of the supply chain, the organization adopted the Lean Startup methodology. This iterative, customer-focused approach helped the company to rapidly innovate and implement digital solutions in its supply chain. The Lean Startup methodology was particularly useful because it prioritizes customer feedback and agile development, enabling the organization to adapt quickly to supply chain challenges. The team executed the following steps:
- Developed a minimum viable product (MVP) for the digital supply chain solution, focusing on core features that address the most pressing efficiency issues.
- Tested the MVP with internal users and key suppliers to gather feedback on its effectiveness and usability.
- Iterated on the digital solution based on feedback, continuously improving its functionality and integration into the supply chain.

Concurrently, the organization utilized the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) to assess and improve its supply chain processes. CMMI provided a structured approach for evaluating the maturity of the company's supply chain processes and identifying areas for improvement. This framework was essential for ensuring that digital transformation efforts were grounded in process excellence. The implementation involved:
- Conducting a baseline assessment of the current maturity level of supply chain processes.
- Identifying process improvement goals aligned with the strategic objectives of the digital transformation initiative.
- Implementing targeted process improvements and measuring the impact on supply chain efficiency and effectiveness.

The strategic initiatives undertaken by the organization to enter emerging markets and innovate its product offerings have yielded significant results. The 5% increase in global market share and the 15% reduction in supply chain costs are particularly noteworthy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the market entry strategy and the digital transformation of the supply chain. The launch of new products contributing to a 10% revenue increase from new market segments indicates successful innovation and alignment with consumer demand for sustainable products. However, the results also highlight areas for improvement, such as the need for enhanced technology transfer and training for local employees, suggesting that the capability-building aspect of the strategy requires further attention. Additionally, while the establishment of local partnerships has been beneficial, the process of navigating local market dynamics and regulatory environments may have been underestimated, impacting the speed and efficiency of market penetration.
For next steps, the organization should focus on deepening its engagement with local partners and regulatory bodies to better navigate the complexities of emerging markets. This includes investing more in local capability building, particularly in technology and sustainability practices, to ensure long-term competitiveness. Expanding the digital transformation efforts beyond the supply chain to include customer engagement and feedback mechanisms could further enhance market responsiveness and innovation. Additionally, exploring strategic acquisitions or alliances could accelerate market penetration and access to local expertise. Finally, a continuous review and adaptation of the market entry and product innovation strategies should be institutionalized to remain agile in the face of evolving market demands and competitive dynamics.
