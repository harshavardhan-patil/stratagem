Source: https://flevy.com/topic/growth-strategy/case-growth-strategy-enhancement-aerospace-manufacturer-competitive-market




Consider this scenario: The organization is a mid-sized aerospace components manufacturer in North America, struggling to scale operations amidst a highly competitive and innovation-driven market.
Despite a strong product portfolio and robust customer base, the company's growth has plateaued, and market share has seen only marginal increases over the past two years. Leadership is looking to identify and capitalize on new growth opportunities while optimizing current operations to achieve sustainable profitability.
In reviewing the organization's strategic positioning, it becomes apparent that the challenges may stem from a lack of diversified growth avenues and an over-reliance on traditional business models. Two hypotheses emerge: firstly, the organization's innovation pipeline may not be aligned with emerging market trends and customer demands; secondly, the existing go-to-market strategy might be insufficient in capturing new segments or geographies.

Strategic Analysis and Execution Methodology

To address these challenges, a structured 5-phase growth strategy process is recommended. This process, akin to those followed by top-tier consulting firms, ensures a comprehensive analysis of market opportunities and the development of a tailored execution plan. The benefits include a clear roadmap for growth, alignment of internal capabilities with market needs, and enhanced competitive positioning.
- Market Analysis and Opportunity Identification: Analyze market trends, customer segments, and competitive landscape to identify growth opportunities. Key questions include: What market segments are underserved? Where can the organization differentiate itself?
- Innovation and Product Development Strategy: Align the organization's innovation efforts with identified opportunities. Activities include assessing the R&D pipeline and potential partnerships or acquisitions.
- Go-to-Market Strategy Refinement: Develop a robust go-to-market strategy for new and existing products. Analyze distribution channels, sales strategies, and marketing campaigns for effectiveness and alignment with growth objectives.
- Operational Excellence and Cost Optimization: Optimize operations to support growth strategies efficiently. Focus on supply chain optimization, production efficiency, and cost reduction techniques.
- Implementation and Change Management: Execute the growth strategy with emphasis on change management to ensure organization-wide adoption. Monitor progress and adjust the strategy as necessary.

Growth Strategy Implementation Challenges & Considerations

While the methodology is robust, executives often question its adaptability to the unique nuances of their organization. The approach is designed to be flexible, allowing for customization based on the organization's specific context and industry dynamics. The iterative nature of the methodology ensures that insights gained in early phases inform subsequent activities, creating a feedback loop that refines the strategy.
Upon full implementation, expected outcomes include a diversified revenue stream, increased market share, and improved profitability. While quantifiable outcomes are case-specific, firms can anticipate a 10-20% increase in market share within targeted segments over a 2-3 year period post-implementation.
Potential challenges include resistance to change within the organization and alignment of cross-functional teams. Effective communication and stakeholder engagement are critical to overcoming these barriers.

Growth Strategy KPIs

KPIS are crucial throughout the implementation process. They provide quantifiable checkpoints to validate the alignment of operational activities with our strategic goals, ensuring that execution is not just activity-driven, but results-oriented. Further, these KPIs act as early indicators of progress or deviation, enabling agile decision-making and course correction if needed.
- Revenue Growth in New Segments:  Indicates the effectiveness of market penetration strategies.
- Customer Acquisition Cost:  Provides insight into the efficiency of marketing and sales efforts.
- Product Development Cycle Time:  Measures the agility of the innovation process.
- Operational Cost Savings:  Reflects the financial impact of operational improvements.

Growth Strategy Best Practices

To improve the effectiveness of implementation, we can leverage best practice documents in Growth Strategy.  These resources below were developed by management consulting firms and Growth Strategy subject matter experts.

Alignment of Growth Strategy with Corporate Vision

Ensuring that the growth strategy aligns with the overarching corporate vision is fundamental. A common pitfall is the divergence of strategic initiatives from the core business mission, leading to diluted brand identity and strategic drift. The alignment process begins with a thorough examination of the corporate vision, followed by a strategic alignment workshop to ensure that all growth initiatives are contributing to the envisioned future state of the company.
A 2020 BCG report highlighted that companies with highly aligned strategies and corporate visions outperformed their competitors by 14% in terms of revenue growth. This underscores the importance of alignment and the need for a mechanism within the growth strategy methodology to regularly review and realign strategic initiatives with the corporate vision.

Integration of Digital Transformation in Growth Strategy

Digital transformation is not merely a technology upgrade but a strategic imperative that can redefine the competitive landscape. In the aerospace industry, digital transformation can unlock new value streams through data analytics, customer experience enhancement, and operational agility. The integration of digital transformation within the growth strategy should be methodical, starting with an assessment of digital maturity and followed by a clear roadmap that links digital initiatives to growth outcomes.
Research by McKinsey has shown that digital leaders in manufacturing can see up to 50% reduction in operational costs and a 45% decrease in time-to-market for new product development. Therefore, the growth strategy must prioritize digital transformation as a key enabler for achieving strategic objectives.

Measuring the Effectiveness of Market Entry Strategies

The effectiveness of market entry strategies is a critical concern. The growth strategy must include a framework for measuring market response, competitor reactions, and the financial impact of market entry. This involves setting up advanced analytics and market intelligence capabilities to capture and analyze relevant data. Performance metrics should be established upfront, with regular reviews to gauge success and make necessary adjustments.
According to a study by PwC, 83% of executives consider market entry strategy success measurement as a top priority. However, only 31% feel they have the right metrics in place. This gap underscores the need for a robust measurement framework as part of the growth strategy execution.

Sustaining Innovation and R&D Efficiency

Innovation and R&D are the lifeblood of the aerospace industry, yet sustaining innovation and maintaining R&D efficiency is challenging. The growth strategy should include a structured approach to managing the innovation pipeline, ensuring that R&D investments are closely tied to strategic growth areas. This involves setting up an innovation governance structure, establishing clear criteria for project selection, and implementing a stage-gate process to manage the R&D portfolio.
Accenture's research indicates that companies that excel at innovation efficiency can achieve up to 27% higher profitability compared to their peers. Therefore, the growth strategy must incorporate best practices in innovation management to sustain long-term growth.
