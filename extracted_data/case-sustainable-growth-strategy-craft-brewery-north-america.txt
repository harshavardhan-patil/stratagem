Source: https://flevy.com/topic/sales-strategy/case-sustainable-growth-strategy-craft-brewery-north-america




Consider this scenario: A mid-sized craft brewery in North America is facing a stagnant sales strategy amidst an increasingly saturated market.
Internally, the brewery struggles with an outdated production process and a lack of digital marketing skills, contributing to a 20% decrease in sales volume over the past two years. Externally, it faces fierce competition from new entrants and changing consumer preferences towards non-alcoholic and low-calorie options. The primary strategic objective of the organization is to innovate its product offerings and revitalize its sales strategy to achieve sustainable growth in the craft beer market.
The craft brewery has recognized the need to address both internal inefficiencies and external market pressures to secure its position in the competitive landscape. The stagnation in sales suggests that the current sales strategy fails to resonate with evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics. Additionally, the lack of digital marketing expertise has limited the brewery's ability to engage with its target audience effectively. To navigate these challenges, a comprehensive strategic plan that encompasses product innovation, digital transformation, and operational excellence is imperative.

For effective implementation, take a look at these Sales Strategy best practices:

Internal Assessment

The brewery possesses a strong brand identity and a loyal customer base, but it is hindered by operational inefficiencies and a lack of digital prowess.
Benchmarking Analysis indicates that the brewery's production processes and cost structures are not aligned with industry best practices, leading to higher production costs and lower margins compared to its peers. Additionally, its digital marketing efforts fall short of the industry standards, limiting its reach and engagement with potential customers.
Organizational Design Analysis suggests that the current organizational structure limits cross-department collaboration and slows decision-making processes, particularly in product innovation and marketing strategies.
Array Analysis highlights a significant gap in the brewery's product portfolio, especially in the growing segments of non-alcoholic and low-calorie beers. This gap represents a missed opportunity in addressing the evolving consumer preferences.

Product Innovation and Diversification

The team applied the Value Innovation framework to guide the Product Innovation and Diversification strategic initiative. Value Innovation, a core element of Blue Ocean Strategy, focuses on making the competition irrelevant by creating uncontested market space that opens up new opportunities. This framework proved invaluable for identifying and capitalizing on unmet needs within the craft beer market. The organization embarked on this path by:
- Conducting a series of workshops with cross-functional teams to redefine the value proposition of craft beer, focusing on health-conscious consumers and sustainability.
- Mapping out the current value curve of the craft beer industry and identifying areas where the company could break from the competition by offering non-alcoholic and low-calorie options.
- Implementing a rapid prototyping approach to product development, allowing for quick feedback loops with select customers to refine the new offerings before a full-scale launch.

Additionally, the team utilized the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework to deepen their understanding of customer needs and motivations. JTBD helped the team to uncover the 'jobs' customers were hiring craft beer to do, such as socializing, enjoying unique flavors, or seeking healthier beverage options. This insight guided the product innovation process by:
- Interviewing a diverse mix of craft beer enthusiasts and health-conscious consumers to gather insights into their drinking habits and preferences.
- Identifying and categorizing the main 'jobs' that craft beer could be 'hired' for, with a particular focus on occasions where non-alcoholic and low-calorie beers could be preferred.
- Aligning the new product development pipeline with these identified 'jobs', ensuring that each new offering had a clear purpose and target audience.

The combination of Value Innovation and JTBD frameworks enabled the brewery to successfully launch a line of non-alcoholic and low-calorie beers, which not only differentiated the brand from its competitors but also attracted a new segment of health-conscious consumers. The strategic initiative resulted in a notable increase in market share within this segment and contributed to revitalizing the brand's image as an innovator in the craft beer industry.

Digital Transformation of Sales and Marketing

For the Digital Transformation of Sales and Marketing initiative, the Resource-Based View (RBV) framework was employed. RBV focuses on leveraging the organization's unique resources and capabilities to gain a competitive advantage. This perspective was crucial in identifying the brewery's internal strengths, such as its brand loyalty and artisanal brewing expertise, and transforming these into digital marketing assets. The process included:
- Assessing the brewery's existing digital assets and capabilities, identifying gaps in digital marketing skills and infrastructure.
- Developing a strategic plan to build digital marketing competencies internally, including training for staff and investments in digital marketing tools.
- Launching targeted online campaigns that leveraged the brewery's unique story and product offerings, measuring impact through engagement and conversion metrics.

The Growth-Share Matrix, another strategic tool, was also applied to prioritize digital marketing investments across different product lines. This framework helped in categorizing the brewery's beers into 'Stars', 'Cash Cows', 'Question Marks', and 'Dogs', which informed the allocation of digital marketing resources. The implementation steps were:
- Conducting a portfolio analysis to classify the brewery's products according to the Growth-Share Matrix criteria.
- Allocating marketing budgets more efficiently, focusing digital marketing efforts on 'Star' and 'Question Mark' products that offered the highest growth potential.
- Developing tailored digital content and campaigns for each category, aiming to maximize reach and engagement for 'Stars' while managing the lifecycle of 'Dogs'.

This led to increased brand awareness, higher engagement rates on digital platforms, and a measurable impact on sales, particularly for the 'Star' products identified in the portfolio analysis.

Operational Excellence in Brewing Processes

The Lean Six Sigma methodology was central to achieving Operational Excellence in Brewing Processes. Lean Six Sigma is a data-driven approach to eliminating defects and improving processes. It was instrumental in streamlining the brewery's production processes, reducing waste, and enhancing product quality. The organization proceeded by:
- Mapping out all brewing and packaging processes to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas of waste.
- Forming cross-functional teams to implement process improvements, utilizing DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) projects targeted at the most critical issues.
- Training staff in Lean Six Sigma principles, empowering them to continuously identify and implement efficiency improvements.

The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework was also adopted to assess and improve the maturity of the brewery's production processes. CMMI provided a structured approach to process improvement across multiple dimensions, including people, procedures, and technology. The brewery applied CMMI by:
- Conducting a baseline assessment to determine the current maturity level of the brewery's production processes.
- Identifying specific areas for process standardization and improvement, setting targets for advancing to higher maturity levels.
- Implementing process changes and monitoring progress through regular reviews and audits, adjusting strategies as needed to ensure continuous improvement.
