Title: Scenic Rail Experience Growth Strategy for Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation

Source: https://flevy.com/topic/sourcing-strategy/case-scenic-rail-experience-growth-strategy-scenic-sightseeing-transportation




Consider this scenario: A premier scenic rail company, offering unparalleled sightseeing experiences, faces challenges in optimizing its sourcing strategy amidst fluctuating market demands and operational costs.
The organization is confronted with a 20% increase in operational expenses, coupled with a steady decline in passenger numbers by 15% over the last two years, due to rising competition and changing tourist preferences. Internally, inefficiencies in supply chain management and a lack of innovative tour packages have further exacerbated the situation. The primary strategic objective is to revitalize the scenic rail experience, streamline operations, and capture a larger market share by enhancing the overall customer experience.
At the heart of the scenic rail company's challenges is an outdated sourcing strategy that fails to leverage new market opportunities and technological advancements. The organization's reliance on traditional supply chains and lack of engagement with digital platforms for customer interaction have limited its market reach and operational efficiency. Additionally, internal resistance to change and a siloed approach to decision-making have hindered its ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving tourism landscape.

Competitive Landscape

The scenic and sightseeing transportation industry is experiencing a significant transformation, driven by shifts in consumer preferences towards personalized and immersive travel experiences. Despite these changes, the industry remains highly competitive, with companies vying for a share of the discretionary spending of global tourists.
Understanding the forces shaping the industry's dynamics is crucial:
- Internal Rivalry:  Competitive intensity is high, with numerous operators offering similar experiences, leading to price-based competition.

Revamp Sourcing Strategy

The strategic initiative to revamp the sourcing strategy was supported by the application of the Resource-Based View (RBV) framework. The RBV framework, which focuses on leveraging a firm's internal resources as a source of competitive advantage, proved instrumental. It was particularly useful for this initiative because it helped the organization identify and exploit its unique resources and capabilities in the sourcing domain to achieve a cost-effective and sustainable supply chain. The team executed the framework with the following steps:
- Conducted an internal audit to catalog all existing sourcing resources and capabilities, including supplier relationships, contracts, and procurement technologies.
- Evaluated these resources for their rarity, value, inimitability, and organization (VRIO) to determine their potential as sustainable competitive advantages.
- Developed strategies to strengthen valuable resources, mitigate weaknesses, and explore new sourcing opportunities that align with these internal strengths.

Additionally, the Kraljic Matrix was utilized to further refine the sourcing strategy. This framework helped classify sourcing categories based on risk and profitability, enabling more strategic supplier management and procurement decisions. The implementation process involved:
- Mapping all sourced goods and services according to the Kraljic Matrix to identify critical items, leverage items, bottleneck items, and non-critical items.
- Formulating specific strategies for each category, such as developing closer relationships with suppliers of critical items and seeking alternative suppliers or substitutes for bottleneck items.

The combined use of the Resource-Based View and the Kraljic Matrix frameworks enabled the organization to significantly enhance its sourcing strategy. This strategic initiative resulted in a more resilient and cost-effective supply chain, optimized supplier relationships, and a better alignment of procurement activities with the company's core competencies and environmental sustainability goals.

Enhance Customer Experience

To enhance the customer experience, the organization employed the Customer Journey Mapping framework. This tool allowed for a comprehensive visualization of the customer's experience with the scenic rail service, from initial awareness through post-trip engagement. It was especially relevant for identifying pain points and opportunities to delight customers at various stages of their journey. The team meticulously executed the framework as follows:
- Mapped out the end-to-end customer journey, identifying all touchpoints with the scenic rail service.
- Gathered and analyzed customer feedback at each touchpoint to identify areas of friction and opportunities for improvement.
- Designed and implemented targeted interventions to enhance the customer experience at critical touchpoints, with a focus on personalization and service excellence.

Furthermore, the Service Blueprint framework was applied to align the organization's internal processes, employee roles, and physical evidence with the desired customer experience. This approach facilitated a deeper understanding of the operational requirements needed to deliver exceptional customer service. The implementation involved:
- Creating a detailed service blueprint that outlined every step of the service delivery process, including front-stage (customer-facing) and back-stage (operational) activities.
- Identifying disconnects between customer expectations and actual service delivery, and designing operational improvements to address these gaps.

The successful implementation of Customer Journey Mapping and Service Blueprint frameworks led to a marked improvement in the overall customer experience. This strategic initiative not only increased customer satisfaction and loyalty but also positioned the scenic rail company as a leader in offering personalized and memorable travel experiences.

Digital Transformation

For the digital transformation initiative, the organization embraced the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) framework to understand and accelerate the adoption of new digital technologies among employees and customers. The DOI framework, with its focus on how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technology spread, was critical in crafting strategies for widespread technology acceptance. Following this framework, the team undertook the following actions:
- Identified key innovations for adoption, including a new booking platform, customer management system, and operational efficiency tools.
- Segmented stakeholders into categories based on their readiness to adopt new technologies, from innovators to laggards.
- Developed targeted communication and training programs to address the specific concerns and needs of each segment, thereby facilitating smoother adoption.

Additionally, the Lean Startup methodology was applied to the development and rollout of new digital tools and platforms. This approach enabled the organization to rapidly prototype, test, and iterate on digital solutions based on real user feedback, minimizing waste and ensuring that the final products truly met user needs. The process included:
- Building minimum viable products (MVPs) for key digital initiatives and deploying them to a small, representative segment of users.
- Collecting and analyzing user feedback to identify areas for improvement or pivot if necessary.
- Iterating on the MVPs based on feedback, gradually expanding the rollout as the products matured and user acceptance increased.
