Source: https://flevy.com/topic/governance/case-sustainable-growth-strategy-eco-tourism-operator-north-america




Consider this scenario: An established eco-tourism operator in North America, well-regarded for its commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly tours, is currently facing challenges with governance and market differentiation.
Despite a strong mission, the organization has seen a 20% decline in year-over-year bookings due to increased competition and a changing regulatory environment that demands higher sustainability standards. Internally, the organization struggles with aligning its operations with these evolving standards, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs. The primary strategic objective is to redefine its market positioning, enhance operational efficiency, and exceed the new sustainability standards to regain its leadership position in the eco-tourism industry.

Strategic Planning

The eco-tourism industry is at a crossroads, with demand for sustainable travel experiences growing by 10% annually  , according to the Global Sustainable Travel Alliance. However, the sector is also becoming increasingly crowded and competitive.
Assessing the competitive landscape, we note the following:
- Internal Rivalry:  Competition within the eco-tourism market is intensifying as new and existing operators vie for a share of the growing demand for eco-friendly travel experiences.
- Supplier Power:  Suppliers of eco-tourism experiences hold significant power due to the limited number of ecologically preserved sites and the high standards required for sustainability practices.
- Buyer Power:  Eco-tourists are becoming more discerning, with high expectations for both the sustainability and the uniqueness of their travel experiences, giving them substantial influence over operators.
- Threat of New Entrants:  The barrier to entry is relatively high due to the specialized knowledge and certifications required to operate sustainably, though this does not deter new, niche entrants.
- Threat of Substitutes:  Alternative forms of travel, including virtual reality experiences of exotic locations, pose a growing threat as technology improves and becomes more accessible.

Emerging trends include the rise of digital platforms for eco-tourism bookings and an increasing emphasis on community involvement and local benefits. These shifts present both opportunities and risks:
- Increased use of digital platforms for bookings offers an opportunity to reach a wider audience but requires significant investment in digital marketing and platform partnerships.
- Greater emphasis on community involvement enhances brand reputation and customer loyalty but poses the risk of increased operational complexity and cost.

Revamp Digital Strategy

The organization employed the Resource-Based View (RBV) framework to guide its digital strategy overhaul. The RBV framework, which focuses on leveraging a company's internal resources as a source of competitive advantage, was instrumental in identifying unique digital capabilities that could be developed. It underscored the importance of distinctive, hard-to-imitate digital assets and competencies. Following this realization, the team took several steps:
- Conducted an internal audit to identify unique digital resources, including proprietary content, customer data, and in-house digital marketing skills.
- Assessed the potential of these resources to provide sustainable competitive advantages in the digital eco-tourism market.
- Developed a strategic plan to enhance these digital assets, focusing on areas like SEO, user experience on the booking platform, and personalized marketing.

Community Engagement Program

To enhance its community engagement program, the organization utilized the Stakeholder Theory framework. This framework emphasizes the importance of identifying and understanding the needs and interests of all stakeholders involved in or affected by the organization's operations. It proved invaluable for designing a program that was both beneficial to local communities and aligned with the company's sustainability goals. The team:
- Mapped out key stakeholders, including local communities, NGOs, government bodies, and suppliers, to understand their expectations and concerns.
- Engaged in dialogue with these stakeholders to co-create community projects that would provide mutual benefits.
- Implemented feedback mechanisms to continuously assess the impact of the engagement program and make necessary adjustments.

Governance and Sustainability Standards Review

The organization adopted the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework to guide its review and enhancement of governance structures and sustainability practices. The TBL framework, which emphasizes the importance of balancing economic, social, and environmental performance, was crucial in redefining the organization's sustainability standards. The team:
- Conducted a comprehensive assessment of current practices in relation to their economic viability, social responsibility, and environmental impact.
- Identified areas for improvement that would allow the organization to not only meet but exceed industry standards in sustainability.
- Developed and implemented new governance policies and operational procedures that aligned with the TBL principles.

The strategic initiatives undertaken by the eco-tourism operator have yielded significant positive outcomes, notably in enhancing digital engagement, customer satisfaction, sustainability compliance, and operational efficiency. The increase in online booking conversion rates and customer loyalty metrics underscores the effectiveness of the digital strategy overhaul and community engagement efforts in differentiating the brand in a competitive market. Achieving full compliance with updated sustainability standards and reducing operational costs through TBL-aligned governance reforms have not only solidified the organization's market position but also contributed to its financial sustainability. However, while these results are commendable, the modest 8% reduction in operational costs suggests there may be untapped opportunities for further efficiency gains. Additionally, the 12% improvement in ESG performance, while significant, indicates room for more aggressive investment in sustainability initiatives to drive stronger outcomes.
Given the successes and areas for improvement identified, the next steps should focus on deepening the organization's commitment to sustainability and operational excellence. It is recommended to explore advanced technologies and innovative practices that could drive further cost reductions and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, expanding the scope and scale of community engagement programs could further differentiate the brand and strengthen customer loyalty. Finally, increasing investments in high-impact sustainability projects, potentially through partnerships or new funding mechanisms, would not only improve ESG performance but also reinforce the organization's leadership position in the eco-tourism industry.
