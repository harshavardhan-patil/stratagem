Implement Value-Based Management

The museum's strategic team adopted the Economic Value Added (EVA) framework to anchor its Value-Based Management initiative. EVA is a measure of a company's financial performance based on the residual wealth calculated by deducting cost of capital from its operating profit. This framework was chosen for its effectiveness in assessing true economic profit and the value it creates for shareholders. It proved instrumental in shifting the museum's focus towards value creation activities that enhance its financial health and operational efficiency.
The museum executed the EVA framework with the following steps:
- Calculated the museum's EVA by determining its net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) and subtracting the capital charge, which is the product of the total capital employed and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
- Identified key operational areas where changes could significantly impact the museum's EVA, focusing on initiatives that could reduce costs or generate additional revenue without substantial capital investment.
- Implemented targeted initiatives such as optimizing exhibit space for efficiency, introducing dynamic pricing for peak visit times, and enhancing retail and membership offerings to increase revenue.
