Optimization of Total Shareholder Value

To address the strategic initiative of optimizing total shareholder value, the organization turned to the Economic Value Added (EVA) framework. EVA provided a clear measure of the company's financial performance by calculating the value created beyond the required return of the company's shareholders. This approach was especially useful for identifying areas where the company was not meeting its cost of capital, thereby pinpointing opportunities for improvement. The steps taken included:
- Calculating the startup's EVA by determining net operating profit after taxes, subtracting the capital charge (the company's total capital multiplied by the cost of capital).
- Identifying business units and projects with negative EVA scores and analyzing underlying causes.
- Implementing targeted strategies to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and discontinue or restructure underperforming projects or units.

Simultaneously, the organization utilized the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) model to refine its focus on profitable customer segments. By understanding the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer, the startup could allocate resources more effectively. This process involved:
- Segmenting customers based on their projected CLV and focusing marketing and sales efforts on high-CLV segments.
- Developing tailored product and service offerings to increase the CLV of existing and potential customers.
- Adjusting pricing strategies to reflect the value provided to different customer segments, thereby maximizing profitability.
