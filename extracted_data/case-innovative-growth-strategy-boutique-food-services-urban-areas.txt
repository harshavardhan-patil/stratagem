Source: https://flevy.com/topic/corporate-entrepreneurship/case-innovative-growth-strategy-boutique-food-services-urban-areas




Consider this scenario: A boutique culinary service provider focused on urban centers is facing a strategic challenge, needing to infuse corporate entrepreneurship into its operations.
The organization has witnessed a 20% decline in customer foot traffic and a 10% dip in overall sales over the last 18 months, attributed to increasing competition from fast-casual dining and meal kit delivery services. Additionally, the company struggles with internal inefficiencies, including outdated culinary technology and a lack of innovative menu offerings, further exacerbating its market position. The primary strategic objective is to reposition the company as a leader in innovative urban dining experiences, leveraging corporate entrepreneurship to drive growth and operational efficiency.
This organization, amidst a rapidly evolving food services industry, is at a critical juncture requiring an immediate strategic overhaul to regain its competitive edge and market share. Initial analysis suggests that the company's slow pace in adopting new culinary technologies and its conservative approach to menu innovation are key contributors to its current predicament. The leadership is now tasked with navigating these challenges while fostering a culture of innovation and agility.

Launch of a Corporate Entrepreneurship Program

The Corporate Entrepreneurship Program initiative was guided by the application of the Resource-Based View (RBV) and the Value Innovation framework. The Resource-Based View, a concept that emphasizes the strategic value of a firm's internal resources, was pivotal in identifying and leveraging the unique capabilities and assets within the organization to foster innovation. This framework proved instrumental in understanding how the company's existing competencies could be optimized or reconfigured to support entrepreneurial activities. Following this insight:
- The organization conducted an in-depth audit of its internal resources, including human capital, technological assets, and intellectual property, to identify underutilized or unique resources that could be leveraged for innovation.
- Teams were then formed around these key resources, tasked with developing new project ideas that could capitalize on the company's strengths.
- Resources were reallocated to support the most promising projects, ensuring that innovative ideas had the necessary backing to be developed and implemented.

The Value Innovation framework complemented RBV by focusing on creating new demand in an uncontested market space, making the competition irrelevant. This approach was particularly useful for the Corporate Entrepreneurship Program as it sought to not only innovate from within but also to redefine the market landscape the company operated in. The implementation steps included:
- Identifying non-customers of the current market and understanding their needs and barriers to entry.
- Developing new offerings that eliminated the factors the industry competes on but failed to deliver value to potential new customers.
- Creating and launching pilot projects to test these new market offerings, using feedback loops to refine the approach continuously.

The results from deploying these frameworks were transformative. The organization successfully launched several new ventures that leveraged its unique resources, leading to the creation of new revenue streams and a stronger competitive position. Moreover, by focusing on value innovation, the company was able to enter and create new market spaces, significantly reducing competitive pressures and reinvigorating its growth trajectory.

Technology Integration for Enhanced Customer Experience

For the strategic initiative focused on integrating technology to enhance customer experience, the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory and Customer Journey Mapping were the chosen frameworks. The Diffusion of Innovations theory, which explains how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technology spread, was crucial in ensuring the successful adoption of new technologies among both employees and customers. The organization:
- Identified key influencers within the organization and among the customer base to act as champions for the new technology.
- Utilized these influencers to demonstrate the benefits and ease of use of the new technology, encouraging wider adoption.
- Monitored adoption rates and gathered feedback to make iterative improvements to the technology integration process.

Complementing DOI, Customer Journey Mapping allowed the organization to visualize the end-to-end experience of its customers, from initial awareness to post-purchase. This holistic view was essential for identifying touchpoints where technology could significantly enhance the customer experience. The process involved:
- Mapping out the current customer journey, identifying all touchpoints with the organization.
- Analyzing each touchpoint to determine where technology could remove friction or enhance the experience.
- Implementing technology solutions at selected touchpoints and measuring the impact on customer satisfaction and engagement.

The implementation of these frameworks led to a marked improvement in customer satisfaction scores and increased efficiency in operations. Technology integration, guided by the DOI theory, saw high adoption rates among employees and customers, leading to smoother interactions and transactions. Meanwhile, Customer Journey Mapping ensured that technology investments were made in areas that directly impacted the customer's experience, resulting in higher engagement and loyalty.

Menu Innovation Focused on Health and Sustainability

The initiative to innovate the menu with a focus on health and sustainability was driven by the application of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework and the Concept-Knowledge (C-K) theory. The Triple Bottom Line framework, which encourages businesses to look beyond profits to include social and environmental considerations, was instrumental in reshaping the menu to reflect health and sustainability goals. By adopting this framework, the organization:
- Evaluated current menu offerings against social, environmental, and economic criteria, identifying areas for improvement.
- Worked with suppliers to source more sustainable and health-conscious ingredients, aligning with TBL principles.
- Developed new menu items that met these criteria, and communicated the value of these changes to customers, enhancing the brand's reputation.

The C-K theory, which posits that the expansion of knowledge occurs through the interplay of concepts and knowledge, was applied to foster innovation in menu development. This approach enabled the team to:
- Challenge existing assumptions about menu design and ingredient use, exploring new concepts that aligned with health and sustainability goals.
- Integrate knowledge from different domains, including nutrition science and sustainable agriculture, to create innovative menu items.
- Test these new concepts with customers, gathering feedback to refine the offerings further.

The combined application of the TBL framework and C-K theory resulted in a menu that not only appealed to health and environmentally conscious consumers but also differentiated the company in a competitive market. This strategic initiative led to increased customer interest and loyalty, as evidenced by positive feedback and higher sales of the new menu items.

However, while these results are commendable, there were areas where outcomes did not fully meet expectations. The pace of technology adoption and the scale of menu innovation could have been more aggressive to capture a larger market share and to better compete with fast-casual dining and meal kit delivery services. Additionally, further leveraging data analytics to personalize customer experiences could have enhanced customer engagement and loyalty even more.
Based on the analysis, the recommended next steps include accelerating the adoption of emerging culinary technologies and expanding the scope of menu innovation to include more diverse health-conscious and sustainably sourced options. It is also advisable to invest in advanced data analytics capabilities to further personalize dining experiences and to engage customers more effectively. Strengthening partnerships with technology providers and suppliers will be crucial in achieving these objectives. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of industry trends and consumer preferences should inform iterative improvements to the strategic initiatives, ensuring the organization remains at the forefront of innovation in the food services industry.
