Source: https://flevy.com/topic/liquidation/case-sustainable-growth-strategy-cosmetic-company-targeting-eco-friendly-market




Consider this scenario: A mid-size cosmetics company, navigating through the challenges of market saturation and competitive pressures, is on the brink of liquidation.
Facing a 20% decline in sales over the past two years, compounded by a surge in eco-conscious consumer demand that it has failed to meet, the company is at a critical juncture. Internally, the organization struggles with outdated production processes and a lack of innovation, which have significantly impaired its ability to compete in the rapidly evolving cosmetics industry. Externally, the rise of digital-first, eco-friendly competitors has eroded its market share. The primary strategic objective of the organization is to reposition itself in the cosmetics market by adopting sustainable practices, thereby tapping into the growing eco-conscious consumer base and reversing its financial decline.
The cosmetics industry is at an inflection point, with sustainability and digital engagement becoming critical factors for success. Companies that fail to adapt to these emerging trends risk falling behind. A closer look at the organization's struggles suggests that its decline may be attributed to an over-reliance on traditional production and marketing methods, coupled with a slow response to the growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products. Additionally, internal resistance to change has stifled innovation, further hindering the company's ability to adapt.

Internal Assessment

The organization has a strong brand heritage and a loyal customer base but is hindered by outdated production processes and a culture resistant to change. Its strengths lie in its established market presence and skilled workforce, yet it struggles to innovate and meet the evolving demands of eco-conscious consumers.
A 4DX analysis highlights the urgency of focusing on critical sustainability goals, engaging employees in the change process, keeping a compelling scoreboard, and creating a cadence of accountability. This approach will help in aligning the organization's efforts towards its strategic objectives.
The McKinsey 7-S analysis underscores misalignments between strategy, structure, systems, and skills, which are currently not conducive to fostering innovation or sustainability initiatives. Emphasizing shared values around sustainability and realigning the organization according to these new strategic objectives are critical steps for success.

Adopt Sustainable Production Practices

The organization adopted the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework to guide its transition to sustainable production practices. TBL, which focuses on three pillars—social, environmental, and financial—proved invaluable for integrating sustainability into the core business strategy. This framework facilitated a holistic view of the company's impact and performance, making it clear that sustainability could drive long-term profitability and not just short-term gains. The team meticulously applied the TBL framework in the following manner:
- Conducted a comprehensive audit of current production practices to assess their environmental, social, and financial impacts.
- Engaged with stakeholders, including suppliers, employees, and customers, to gather insights and set realistic goals for improvement in all three TBL dimensions.
- Implemented changes in sourcing, production, and distribution to minimize environmental harm, improve community relations, and ensure economic viability.

The Value Chain Analysis was another critical framework utilized to identify and optimize the value-creating activities in the production process. By dissecting each step of the cosmetics production and distribution process, the organization was able to pinpoint inefficiencies and areas where sustainable practices could be integrated seamlessly. Following this analysis, the team:
- Mapped out the entire cosmetics value chain, from raw material sourcing to customer delivery.
- Identified key activities that had the highest environmental impact and targeted them for improvement.
- Worked with suppliers to source sustainable materials and with logistics partners to reduce carbon footprint.

Financially, the move towards sustainability opened up new markets and customer segments, leading to a noticeable improvement in sales and profitability.

Digital Transformation for Enhanced Customer Engagement

For the digital transformation initiative, the organization embraced the Customer Journey Mapping (CJM) framework. CJM allowed the company to visualize the customer's experience from initial contact, through the process of engagement and into a long-term relationship. This perspective was crucial for identifying touchpoints where digital interventions could enhance the customer experience. The implementation process involved:
- Mapping out all customer touchpoints across multiple channels and identifying pain points and opportunities for digital enhancement.
- Developing digital solutions, such as a personalized e-commerce platform and mobile applications, to address these pain points.
- Integrating feedback loops into the digital platforms to continuously improve the customer experience based on real user data.

The Resource-Based View (RBV) framework was also applied to ensure that the digital transformation leveraged the company's unique resources and capabilities. By focusing on internal strengths, the organization could create a sustainable competitive advantage in the digital space. The team:
- Conducted an internal audit to identify unique resources, such as proprietary technologies or specialized expertise, that could be utilized in the digital transformation.
- Aligned digital initiatives with these unique resources to create distinctive customer experiences that competitors could not easily replicate.
- Invested in upskilling employees and acquiring new technologies that would further strengthen the company's digital capabilities.

The combination of CJM and RBV frameworks significantly accelerated the organization's digital transformation, leading to increased customer engagement and loyalty. The enhanced digital presence also allowed the company to tap into valuable customer insights, driving continuous improvement in product offerings and customer service.

Product Innovation and Diversification

In pursuing product innovation and diversification, the organization utilized the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) framework. DOI helped the company understand how new products are adopted within a market and the characteristics of early adopters. This understanding was critical for the successful introduction of the new eco-friendly cosmetics line. The implementation steps included:
- Identifying characteristics of potential early adopters among the existing customer base and targeting them with initial marketing efforts.
- Utilizing influencers and eco-conscious community leaders to help spread the word about the new product line.
- Gathering early feedback from initial users to refine and improve the product offerings before a wider market rollout.

The Lean Startup framework was also instrumental in this initiative, emphasizing rapid prototyping, testing, and iteration to minimize risks and adapt quickly to market feedback. The organization:
- Developed minimum viable products (MVPs) for the new eco-friendly line to test market assumptions with minimal resources.
- Implemented a build-measure-learn feedback loop to quickly iterate on product designs based on customer feedback.
- Used customer data and insights to continuously refine and expand the product line, ensuring it met the evolving needs of the market.
