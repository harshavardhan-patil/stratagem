Source: https://flevy.com/topic/business-development/case-esports-audience-engagement-growth-strategy




Consider this scenario: The company is an emerging esports platform that has recently launched its services, targeting both casual viewers and dedicated gamers.
Despite initial success, the platform has struggled to scale its user base and increase engagement rates. With numerous competitors in the space, the company aims to differentiate itself and develop a business development strategy that caters to a diverse audience while optimizing its marketing spend, retaining users, and maximizing revenue from its content and events.
Upon examining the situation, it's hypothesized that the esports platform's challenges stem from a lack of targeted user acquisition strategies and an underdeveloped value proposition for its core audience segments. Another potential root cause could be the insufficient use of analytics and user feedback to inform content and engagement strategies.

Strategic Analysis and Execution Methodology

The resolution of these issues can be effectively approached with a 5-phase strategic analysis and execution methodology that ensures a comprehensive understanding of the market and the implementation of a tailored business development plan. This methodology, widely embraced by leading consulting firms, allows for a systematic exploration of the company's challenges and the development of actionable insights.
- Market Analysis and Segmentation: In this initial phase, a deep dive into the esports industry will identify trends, key market segments, and competitive dynamics. Key activities include analyzing market size, growth rates, and consumer demographics. This phase aims to develop a nuanced understanding of the audience and the competitive landscape. Potential insights might include identification of underserved market segments or emerging trends that the company can capitalize on.
- Value Proposition Refinement: The subsequent phase focuses on refining the company's value proposition for its identified audience segments. Activities include the analysis of current offerings, user feedback, and competitor strategies. The goal is to delineate a unique positioning that resonates with the target audience, potentially leading to increased user retention and engagement.
- Strategic Partnership Development: Identifying and establishing strategic partnerships is key to expanding reach and content offerings. This phase involves mapping potential partners, assessing synergies, and structuring partnership models. Strategic alliances can provide a competitive edge and drive user acquisition and engagement.
- Engagement Strategy Optimization: With a focus on user retention, this phase includes the development of engagement strategies based on user behavior analytics. Activities involve A/B testing of new features, content personalization, and community-building initiatives. Insights from this phase can lead to increased user time spent on the platform and improved engagement metrics.
- Performance Measurement and Scaling: The final phase involves establishing KPIs to measure the effectiveness of the implemented strategies. The organization will also develop a scalable business model to accommodate growth. This phase ensures that the company's growth is sustainable and that strategies can be adapted based on performance data.

Business Development Implementation Challenges & Considerations

The CEO may be concerned about the time and resources required to execute such a methodology. It's important to communicate that while the process is thorough, it is designed to be iterative and agile, allowing for quick pivots based on data-driven insights. The structured approach is beneficial for making informed decisions that can lead to a solid ROI.
Upon successful implementation, the company can expect to see increased user acquisition rates, higher engagement and retention metrics, and improved monetization of content. These outcomes should be quantifiable through increased monthly active users (MAU) and average revenue per user (ARPU).
Potential implementation challenges include resistance to change within the organization and the need to rapidly adapt to evolving market conditions. Overcoming these challenges will require strong leadership and a culture that embraces continuous improvement and innovation.

Business Development KPIs

KPIS are crucial throughout the implementation process. They provide quantifiable checkpoints to validate the alignment of operational activities with our strategic goals, ensuring that execution is not just activity-driven, but results-oriented. Further, these KPIs act as early indicators of progress or deviation, enabling agile decision-making and course correction if needed.
- Monthly Active Users (MAU): Indicates the platform's ability to attract and retain users.
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Measures the effectiveness of monetization strategies.
- User Engagement Rate: Reflects the level of user interaction with the platform's content and features.
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Assesses the efficiency of marketing spend in acquiring new users.
- Partnership Contribution Margin: Gauges the financial impact of strategic partnerships on the overall business.

Business Development Best Practices

To improve the effectiveness of implementation, we can leverage best practice documents in Business Development.  These resources below were developed by management consulting firms and Business Development subject matter experts.

ESport Sustainability

The sustainability of the esports platform's user growth and retention is a critical concern. In light of this, the application of analytics and machine learning to predict churn and user preferences can significantly improve retention rates. Accenture's research indicates that companies leveraging advanced analytics can see retention rates improve by up to 15%. By implementing predictive models, the platform can proactively offer personalized content and incentives that reduce the likelihood of user attrition.
Moreover, the integration of social features that foster a sense of community can also play a pivotal role in user retention. According to a study by Deloitte, platforms that successfully build online communities see engagement rates climb by as much as 20%. Implementing features such as user-generated content, forums, and social sharing can create a more sticky user experience that encourages regular interaction with the platform.

Monetization Strategy

Monetization strategies beyond traditional advertising are necessary to diversify revenue streams. Innovative approaches such as microtransactions for digital goods, premium subscriptions for exclusive content, and leveraging user data for targeted marketing can all contribute to the financial health of the platform. A report from McKinsey highlights that platforms which diversify their revenue models can increase their revenue potential by 25-30%. By offering a range of monetization options that cater to different user segments, the platform can maximize its revenue potential while enhancing user experience.
Additionally, developing esports-specific economic models, such as in-app currency and betting systems, can further drive monetization. Data from PwC suggests that platforms which integrate in-app purchases see an average increase in ARPU by 10%. Capitalizing on the competitive nature of esports by allowing users to place bets or purchase in-platform currency to support their favorite teams or players can create an engaging and profitable ecosystem.

Strategic Partnerships

Strategic partnerships are essential for content diversification and broadening the user base. Exploring partnerships with game developers, event organizers, and even non-endemic brands can enrich the platform's offerings. BCG's analysis reveals that platforms that engage in strategic partnerships see their content diversity increase by up to 35%, attracting a wider audience. These partnerships can lead to exclusive content opportunities, co-branded events, and cross-promotion that can attract new users and retain existing ones.
It's also beneficial to consider educational partnerships with institutions to create esports curriculums and training programs. This not only contributes to the growth of the esports ecosystem but also positions the platform as a leader in the development of professional and amateur talent. According to a study by EY, companies that position themselves as industry educators can see a reputational boost that correlates with a 5-10% increase in user acquisition rates.

Technology Investments for Scalability

In terms of scalability and infrastructure, a robust technological foundation is non-negotiable. As user numbers grow, the platform must be able to handle increased traffic without compromising performance. Investing in cloud solutions and scalable architecture is key. Gartner reports that platforms that invest in scalable cloud solutions can reduce downtime by 20%, ensuring a consistent and quality user experience.
Furthermore, the deployment of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and edge computing can reduce latency, a critical factor in the live streaming of esports events. Insights from Capgemini suggest that platforms which prioritize low-latency streaming technologies can increase viewership of live events by 15%, as they offer a more synchronous and engaging viewing experience.
