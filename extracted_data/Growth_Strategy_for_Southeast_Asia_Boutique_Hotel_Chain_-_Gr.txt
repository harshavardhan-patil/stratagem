Consider this scenario:
The organization has experienced a 20% decrease in occupancy rates and a 15% downturn in revenue over the past two years, amidst a highly competitive market and changing consumer preferences towards accommodation. Increased competition from international hotel chains and local boutique accommodations has intensified market saturation, leading to price wars and reduced customer loyalty. Additionally, the chain is grappling with the need to continuously innovate its sustainability practices to meet the evolving expectations of eco-conscious travelers. The primary strategic objective of the organization is to achieve sustainable growth by enhancing its competitive advantage, optimizing operational efficiency, and expanding its market presence in Southeast Asia.
