Source: https://flevy.com/topic/consumer-decision-journey/case-sustainable-growth-strategy-d2c-beverage-company-north-america




Consider this scenario: A rapidly evolving D2C beverage company in North America, known for its innovative health drinks, is currently navigating the complexities of the consumer decision journey, which has become increasingly fragmented due to digital advancements.
Facing a 20% decline in customer retention rates over the past two years and a 30% increase in customer acquisition costs, the organization is also confronting external pressures from both established beverage companies and emerging health drink startups vying for market share. Internally, the company struggles with supply chain inefficiencies and a lack of data-driven marketing strategies. The primary strategic objective of the organization is to solidify its market position by enhancing the consumer decision journey, optimizing supply chain operations, and deploying targeted marketing strategies to improve customer retention and reduce acquisition costs.
The D2C beverage company at the center of this strategic plan is experiencing stagnation in a market that is otherwise ripe with opportunity. Initial analysis suggests that the root of its challenges may stem from an underoptimized consumer decision journey and inefficiencies in supply chain and marketing operations. Additionally, a competitive and ever-changing market landscape demands a more agile and data-driven approach to consumer engagement and operations management.

Optimize the Consumer Decision Journey

The team applied the Customer Journey Mapping framework to deeply understand and subsequently optimize the consumer decision journey. This framework is instrumental in visualizing the path that customers take from awareness to purchase and beyond, highlighting key interactions and touchpoints with the brand. It proved invaluable for identifying gaps and opportunities in the current journey to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction. The process entailed:
- Mapping out the existing consumer decision journey, identifying all touchpoints across digital and physical channels.
- Analyzing customer feedback, behavior analytics, and conversion data to pinpoint friction points and areas of drop-off.
- Designing an optimized journey with improved touchpoints, personalized interactions, and streamlined paths to purchase based on the analysis.

Additionally, the team utilized the Value Proposition Canvas to ensure that the marketing messages and product offerings were closely aligned with customer needs and wants. This framework helped in understanding what customers value and how the company can better solve their problems or fulfill their needs. The implementation steps included:
- Segmenting the customer base and identifying the jobs, pains, and gains of each segment through interviews and market research.
- Aligning the companyâ€™s products and services with the identified customer jobs, pains, and gains to enhance the value proposition at each touchpoint in the consumer decision journey.

The results of implementing these frameworks were significant. The optimized consumer decision journey led to a 25% improvement in customer retention rates and a 20% reduction in customer acquisition costs. The alignment of the value proposition with customer needs resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores and increased brand loyalty.

Supply Chain Optimization

For the strategic initiative focused on supply chain optimization, the organization adopted the Demand-Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP) framework. DDMRP is a multi-echelon planning and execution method that protects and promotes the flow of relevant information and materials through the supply chain. This method was chosen for its ability to dynamically adjust inventory levels to actual market demand, reducing lead times and improving supply chain responsiveness. The implementation involved:
- Segmenting products based on variability in demand and supply, and applying differentiated inventory positioning and buffer profiles.
- Establishing dynamic buffer levels and adjusting them in real-time based on daily sales and supply chain signals to better align production and purchasing with actual market demand.

Simultaneously, the Lean Six Sigma methodology was employed to identify and eliminate waste and reduce variability in supply chain processes. This approach complemented DDMRP by ensuring that operational efficiency was maximized. Key actions taken included:
- Mapping out all supply chain processes to identify non-value-added activities and sources of process variation.
- Implementing targeted improvements projects focused on eliminating waste and reducing process variation.

The combined implementation of DDMRP and Lean Six Sigma frameworks led to a 15% reduction in operational costs and a 30% improvement in product availability for customers. These enhancements not only optimized the supply chain but also contributed to a more agile and customer-responsive operation.

Product Innovation and Sustainability

To drive the product innovation and sustainability initiative, the organization utilized the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework. JTBD is a tool for understanding the deeper needs of customers in terms of the jobs they are trying to get done. This perspective was crucial for identifying innovative product opportunities that could meet emerging consumer needs. Following this framework, the team:
- Conducted in-depth interviews with current and potential customers to uncover the jobs they were hiring health drinks to perform.
- Identified unmet needs and emerging trends in health and sustainability that the companyâ€™s products could address.

In parallel, the Sustainable Business Model Canvas was applied to ensure that new product innovations were not only appealing to customers but also environmentally sustainable and economically viable for the company. This involved:
- Assessing the environmental impact of new product ideas, including sourcing, production, and lifecycle.
- Integrating sustainability into the value proposition, key activities, and customer segments of the business model canvas for each new product.
