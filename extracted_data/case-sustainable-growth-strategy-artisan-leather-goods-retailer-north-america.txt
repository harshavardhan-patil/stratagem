Source: https://flevy.com/topic/business-model-design/case-sustainable-growth-strategy-artisan-leather-goods-retailer-north-america




Consider this scenario: A boutique artisan leather goods retailer, known for its handcrafted accessories and small-batch production model, faces challenges in scaling its business model design.
The organization has seen a 20% dip in year-over-year sales, attributed to intensified competition from mass-produced brands and a shift in consumer buying habits towards e-commerce platforms. Additionally, the retailer struggles with supply chain inefficiencies and the high costs of sustainable materials, which further erode its profit margins. The primary strategic objective of the organization is to achieve sustainable growth by enhancing its online presence, streamlining operations, and exploring new market segments without compromising its commitment to craftsmanship and sustainability.
This retailer's situation underscores the pressing need to refine its business model design to navigate the dual challenges of operational efficiency and market differentiation. It appears that the root causes of its challenges lie in an over-reliance on traditional retail models in an increasingly digital marketplace and a failure to optimize its supply chain for both cost and sustainability.

Market Analysis

The artisan leather goods market is characterized by a growing consumer preference for unique, high-quality, and ethically produced items. However, this niche faces stiff competition from larger, more established brands with robust online platforms.
Analyzing the competitive forces reveals:
- Internal Rivalry:  High, as smaller artisans and larger brands vie for the same conscientious consumer base.
- Supplier Power:  Moderate, with a limited number of suppliers offering sustainably sourced leather contributing to higher bargaining power.
- Buyer Power:  High, due to the abundance of alternatives and ease of switching between brands.
- Threat of New Entrants:  Moderate, hindered by the niche's barriers to entry such as the craftsmanship skill and sustainable sourcing networks.
- Threat of Substitutes:  Low to moderate, with substitutes including vegan leather and other non-leather products.

Internal Assessment

The organization boasts exceptional craftsmanship and a strong brand ethos centered on sustainability, yet struggles with digital marketing and operational inefficiencies.
In a STEEPLE analysis, socio-cultural trends favor the brand's value proposition, but technological challenges in e-commerce and digital marketing are significant weaknesses. Economically, the high cost of sustainable materials impacts pricing strategies. Environmentally, the brand is well-positioned to capitalize on growing consumer awareness around sustainability.
A Value Chain Analysis highlights strengths in inbound logistics with a robust network of sustainable suppliers and in sales through a loyal customer base. However, significant inefficiencies exist in operations, particularly in inventory management and order fulfillment, and in the lack of a strong online sales platform.
In a McKinsey 7-S Framework analysis, the organization's shared values and skills are strong, but its style, staff, and systems need realignment towards a more digital and efficient operational model.

Digital Transformation of Sales Channels

The organization adopted the Blue Ocean Strategy and the Digital Maturity Model to guide the digital transformation of its sales channels. The Blue Ocean Strategy, a concept that encourages companies to create new market spaces or "blue oceans" rather than competing in overcrowded industries, was instrumental in identifying untapped digital market opportunities. It proved invaluable in steering the organization toward a less competitive, more profitable online niche. The Digital Maturity Model helped assess the company's current digital capabilities and provided a roadmap for achieving the desired state of digital transformation.
Following these frameworks, the team executed the following steps:
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the current market to identify oversaturated areas and potential "blue oceans" within the digital marketplace.
- Evaluated the organization's existing digital capabilities across various dimensions, including strategy, culture, organization, and capabilities, to establish a baseline digital maturity level.
- Developed a strategic plan that outlined the steps needed to transition from the current state to a targeted, more digitally mature organization, focusing on areas such as e-commerce platform enhancement and digital marketing.

As a result of these frameworks' implementation, the organization successfully launched a distinctive e-commerce platform that capitalized on untapped market opportunities, significantly increasing its online visibility and sales. The Digital Maturity Model application provided a clear pathway for continuous improvement in digital capabilities, ensuring the organization remains competitive in the evolving digital landscape.

Optimization of the Supply Chain for Sustainability and Efficiency

For this strategic initiative, the organization utilized the Lean Six Sigma and the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) frameworks. Lean Six Sigma, with its focus on reducing waste and improving process efficiency, was pivotal in streamlining the supply chain operations. The Triple Bottom Line framework, emphasizing the importance of balancing economic, social, and environmental considerations, guided the company towards more sustainable practices. These frameworks were chosen for their complementary strengths in enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability simultaneously.
The implementation process involved:
- Mapping out the entire supply chain process to identify waste and inefficiencies using Lean Six Sigma methodologies.
- Assessing the impact of supply chain operations on social, environmental, and economic factors based on the Triple Bottom Line framework to ensure sustainability was at the core of supply chain optimizations.
- Re-engineering supply chain processes to eliminate waste and incorporate sustainable practices, such as partnering with eco-friendly suppliers and adopting green logistics solutions.

Expansion into New Market Segments with a Business Model Design Focused on Customization

The organization embraced the Value Innovation and Canvas Business Model frameworks to support the expansion into new market segments through customization. Value Innovation, which focuses on making the competition irrelevant by creating new value for customers, was critical in identifying opportunities for customization that no competitors offered. The Canvas Business Model provided a structured approach to rethinking the organization's business model to incorporate these customization services effectively.
In implementing these frameworks, the team:
- Identified unique customization options that could significantly enhance customer value, using the principles of Value Innovation.
- Mapped out the current business model and used the Canvas Business Model to integrate customization services into the value proposition, customer relationships, and revenue streams.
- Developed a detailed plan for operationalizing customization services, including technology investments, process changes, and training requirements.

The strategic initiatives undertaken by the boutique artisan leather goods retailer have yielded substantial results, notably in online sales growth, operational cost reduction, and customer engagement. The successful launch of an enhanced e-commerce platform and the optimization of the supply chain for sustainability and efficiency have directly contributed to these achievements. The introduction of a customization service has not only differentiated the brand but also attracted a new segment of customers, further driving revenue growth. However, the results were not without their challenges. The digital transformation, while successful, required significant investment in technology and training, indicating a potential underestimation of the resources needed for such an endeavor. Additionally, while the supply chain optimizations improved efficiency, the high cost of sustainable materials remains a challenge, suggesting that further innovations in cost management are necessary.
For the next steps, it is recommended to continue investing in digital capabilities to maintain the momentum of online sales growth. This includes enhancing the user experience on the e-commerce platform and exploring advanced digital marketing strategies to increase brand visibility. To address the high costs of sustainable materials, further exploration into alternative sustainable materials that are both cost-effective and meet the brand's sustainability standards is advised. Additionally, expanding the customization service to include more options and leveraging customer data to personalize the shopping experience can further increase customer engagement and loyalty. Finally, continuous monitoring and adjustment of the supply chain operations should be conducted to ensure they remain efficient and aligned with sustainability goals.
