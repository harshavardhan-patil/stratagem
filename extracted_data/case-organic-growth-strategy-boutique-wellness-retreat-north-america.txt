Source: https://flevy.com/topic/new-product-development/case-organic-growth-strategy-boutique-wellness-retreat-north-america




Consider this scenario: A boutique wellness retreat located in North America, renowned for its personalized health and wellness programs, faces the strategic challenge of new product development amidst a saturated market.
The retreat has observed a 20% decline in year-over-year bookings, attributed to increased competition from new wellness resorts and a shift in consumer preferences towards digital wellness platforms. Simultaneously, internal challenges include outdated program offerings and a lack of innovation in wellness services. The primary strategic objective is to diversify and enhance its wellness offerings through strategic new product development, aimed at reclaiming market share and improving profitability.
The situation at hand indicates that the retreat is at a pivotal juncture. Despite its reputable standing in the wellness industry, the organization is losing ground due to a lack of innovation and adaptation to evolving market demands. This erosion of market position suggests that the retreat's historical success formula may no longer be as effective in the current industry context.

New Product Development

The team utilized the Kano Model alongside the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework to guide the New Product Development strategic initiative. The Kano Model, a theory for product development and customer satisfaction, categorizes customer preferences into must-be, one-dimensional, and delighter features. This model proved invaluable in prioritizing features for the new wellness programs. Simultaneously, the JTBD framework helped the organization understand the underlying reasons customers hire a product or service, focusing on the progress they are trying to make in a particular circumstance.
Implementing these frameworks, the team undertook the following steps:
- Conducted customer interviews and surveys to categorize wellness program features according to the Kano Model, identifying must-have elements versus potential delighters.
- Applied the JTBD framework by hosting workshops with existing and potential customers to uncover the "jobs" they were hiring wellness programs to do for them, such as stress reduction, physical fitness improvement, or finding mental peace.
- Integrated findings from both frameworks to design new wellness programs that not only met basic customer expectations but also included elements designed to surprise and delight, thereby differentiating the retreat's offerings in the market.

The application of the Kano Model and JTBD framework significantly informed the development of new, customer-centric wellness programs. The retreat successfully launched programs that not only met the foundational needs of their clientele but also introduced innovative features that set the retreat apart from competitors. Customer feedback post-launch indicated high satisfaction levels, with particular appreciation for the unexpected features, leading to an increase in bookings and customer engagement.

Operational Efficiency Improvement

For the Operational Efficiency Improvement initiative, the team adopted the Theory of Constraints (TOC) and Lean Six Sigma methodologies. The Theory of Constraints is a management paradigm that identifies the most significant limiting factor (constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal and systematically improves that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor. Lean Six Sigma, on the other hand, is a method that relies on a collaborative team effort to improve performance by systematically removing waste and reducing variation.
Following the adoption of these methodologies, the organization:
- Identified the retreat's major operational bottlenecks through TOC's Five Focusing Steps, pinpointing inefficient program scheduling and guest intake processes as primary constraints.
- Applied Lean Six Sigma tools to analyze and streamline these processes, employing DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) phases to ensure continuous improvement.
- Implemented solutions such as digital scheduling tools and simplified check-in procedures, significantly reducing wait times and improving the guest experience.

Market Expansion

To support the Market Expansion initiative, the team employed the Market Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning (STP) model alongside the Diffusion of Innovations theory. The STP model helped the organization to identify distinct segments within the wellness industry, target the most viable segments, and position its offerings effectively to each segment. The Diffusion of Innovations theory was used to understand how the retreat's new hybrid wellness experiences could be adopted by the market, identifying key influencers and communication strategies to accelerate adoption.
In implementing these strategies, the organization took the following actions:
- Segmented the market based on demographics, psychographics, and wellness needs, identifying high-potential segments for the hybrid wellness experiences.
- Targeted these segments with tailored marketing messages, leveraging key influencers within each segment to promote the new offerings.
- Positioned the hybrid experiences as a unique blend of traditional retreat benefits with the convenience and accessibility of digital platforms, addressing the specific "jobs" identified through the JTBD framework in the product development phase.
