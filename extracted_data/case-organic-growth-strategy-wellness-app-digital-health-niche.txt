Source: https://flevy.com/topic/human-centered-design/case-organic-growth-strategy-wellness-app-digital-health-niche




Consider this scenario: A pioneering wellness application, integrating human-centered design to enhance user engagement and retention, faces a critical juncture in its journey toward market dominance.
Despite a commendable user base growth of 20% year-over-year, the app struggles with a 30% user churn rate and a competitive landscape that is becoming increasingly crowded with new entrants boasting similar or superior features. External pressures include rapidly changing consumer health trends and privacy regulations impacting user data management. The primary strategic objective of the organization is to solidify its market position by enhancing user engagement and expanding its user base through innovative wellness solutions.
The wellness app in question stands at a pivotal point, with its significant user growth overshadowed by a high churn rate and fierce competition. Preliminary insights suggest that the core issues may stem from the app's inability to continually innovate and personalize user experiences at a pace that matches or exceeds market expectations. Additionally, internal challenges, such as data management practices affected by evolving privacy laws, may be impeding the organization’s agility and responsiveness to user needs.

Implement Advanced Personalization Features

The strategic initiative to implement advanced personalization features was significantly bolstered by the application of the Value Proposition Canvas (VPC) and the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework. The VPC, developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is instrumental in understanding what customers value and designing products that address those needs directly. It proved essential for tailoring the wellness app’s features to the specific preferences and requirements of its users. Following this framework, the team embarked on a detailed analysis:
- Identified the users' most significant jobs to be done, pains, and gains by analyzing user feedback and engagement data.
- Mapped out how the app’s features could alleviate user pains and enhance gains, focusing on AI-driven personalization.
