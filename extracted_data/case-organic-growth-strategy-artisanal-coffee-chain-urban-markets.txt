Source: https://flevy.com/topic/portfolio-strategy/case-organic-growth-strategy-artisanal-coffee-chain-urban-markets




Consider this scenario: An emerging artisanal coffee chain, recognized for its unique blends and sustainable sourcing practices, faces a strategic challenge in formulating an effective portfolio strategy.
Despite a loyal customer base, the chain has witnessed a 12% reduction in foot traffic and a 5% dip in same-store sales year over year, attributed to increased competition and changing consumer preferences. Internal challenges include operational inefficiencies and a lack of coherent marketing strategy. The primary strategic objective is to achieve organic growth by enhancing customer experience, optimizing operations, and expanding its market presence in strategic urban locations.
The artisanal coffee market has recently become highly competitive, with a surge in both consumer interest and the number of players in the space. This competition, coupled with evolving consumer preferences towards sustainability and quality, presents both challenges and opportunities for growth.

Strategic Planning Analysis

- Internal Rivalry:  The presence of numerous local and international coffee chains and independent cafes has intensified competition, eroding market share and pressuring prices.
- Supplier Power:  With a focus on sustainable and ethically sourced coffee beans, supplier power is moderate but increasing, as demand for these premium products grows.
- Buyer Power:  High, due to the abundance of choices and ease of switching between brands for consumers.
- Threat of New Entrants:  Moderate, given the relatively low barrier to entry for opening a coffee shop but high for those trying to scale.
- Threat of Substitutes:  High, with consumers having a wide array of alternative caffeinated beverages and leisure spaces.

Internal Assessment

The organization has established a strong brand around quality and sustainability but faces challenges in operational efficiency and consistency across locations. Benchmarking against leading chains reveals gaps in digital engagement and customer loyalty programs. Core competencies in product quality and customer service remain strong, but the chain needs to develop capabilities in digital marketing and analytics. Distinctive capabilities analysis suggests that leveraging data analytics for personalized marketing and operational improvements could provide a competitive edge.

Enhance Digital Customer Engagement

The implementation team utilized the Customer Journey Mapping and Value Proposition Canvas frameworks to enhance the digital customer engagement initiative. Customer Journey Mapping allowed the team to visualize the complete experience of a customer from initial contact, through the process of engagement and into a long-term relationship. It was particularly useful for identifying touchpoints where customers interacted with the brand and pinpointing areas for improvement. The Value Proposition Canvas helped the team align the company's products and services with customer needs, desires, and pain points, ensuring that the digital engagement strategy was effectively targeted.
For the Customer Journey Mapping, the team executed the following steps:
- Mapped out all existing customer touchpoints across various channels and identified critical moments that matter to the customer.
- Conducted customer interviews and surveys to gather feedback on their experience at each touchpoint.
- Analyzed the data to find gaps and opportunities for enhancing digital engagement.

Portfolio Strategy Refinement

The Portfolio Strategy Refinement initiative was supported by the use of the Growth-Share Matrix and Scenario Planning frameworks. The Growth-Share Matrix helped the organization categorize its stores based on market growth and market share, identifying which ones to invest in, maintain, or divest. Scenario Planning enabled the team to anticipate potential future market conditions and plan strategic responses, making the portfolio strategy more resilient to change. These frameworks were instrumental in optimizing the company's store portfolio for sustainable growth.
Applying the Growth-Share Matrix involved:
- Classifying each store as a Star, Cash Cow, Question Mark, or Dog based on its market growth and share.
- Allocating resources strategically, investing in Stars and Cash Cows while considering divestment from Dogs.
- Developing specific action plans for Question Marks to either turn them into Stars or phase them out.

The implementation of strategic initiatives has yielded significant improvements across key areas of the business, demonstrating the effectiveness of the chosen strategies. The 15% increase in customer engagement and a 20% increase in marketing campaign effectiveness are particularly noteworthy, as they directly contribute to higher customer retention and acquisition rates, addressing the initial challenge of declining foot traffic and same-store sales. The Operational Excellence Program's success in reducing costs and improving service speed has likely contributed to the observed increase in customer satisfaction, further supporting the chain's growth objectives. However, while the Portfolio Strategy Refinement has led to a 10% improvement in portfolio performance, the report does not specify the net growth in market share or how the closure of underperforming stores and opening of new ones in strategic locations has affected overall revenue and profitability. This omission suggests that while strategic direction appears sound, the financial impact of these moves remains unclear, indicating a potential area for deeper analysis.
Considering the results, it is recommended to continue investing in digital engagement and operational excellence, as these areas have shown clear benefits. However, to enhance outcomes further, it is advisable to integrate a more comprehensive analytics framework that can provide deeper insights into customer behavior and preferences, potentially uncovering new growth opportunities or areas for improvement. Additionally, a more detailed financial analysis of the Portfolio Strategy Refinement's impact on revenue and profitability could help in fine-tuning future expansion strategies, ensuring that new store openings contribute positively to the bottom line. Finally, exploring partnerships or collaborations that align with the brand's focus on sustainability and quality could open up new channels for growth and customer acquisition.
