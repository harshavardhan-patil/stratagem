Source: https://flevy.com/topic/business-process-re-engineering/case-sustainable-growth-strategy-apparel-retailer-sustainable-fashion




Consider this scenario: An established clothing and accessories store specializing in sustainable fashion is facing the strategic challenge of business process re-engineering.
The retailer has experienced a 20% decline in foot traffic and a 15% decrease in sales over the past two years, attributed to the rise of e-commerce and changing consumer preferences towards online shopping. The organization's primary strategic objective is to re-engineer its business processes to enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and adopt a more robust digital presence.
This organization, despite its strong commitment to sustainability and ethical fashion, is at a crossroads due to evolving market dynamics and consumer behaviors. The underlying issues seem to stem from outdated operational processes and a slow adaptation to digital marketplaces, which have become increasingly vital for retail success. Additionally, there appears to be a disconnection between the brand's online and offline customer engagement strategies, leading to missed opportunities in building customer loyalty and expanding market reach.

Environmental Analysis

The clothing and accessories retail industry, particularly in the sustainable fashion niche, is experiencing rapid transformation due to shifting consumer values towards sustainability and ethical production. However, the rise of digital platforms and changing shopping habits pose significant challenges for traditional retailers.
- Internal Rivalry:  High, with both established brands and new entrants vying for market share in the sustainable fashion sector.
- Supplier Power:  Moderate, as retailers seek to establish partnerships with ethically-sourced and sustainable suppliers.

Business Process Re-engineering for Digital Transformation

The organization adopted the Value Chain Analysis framework, as proposed by Michael Porter, to guide its Business Process Re-engineering for Digital Transformation initiative. Value Chain Analysis is instrumental in understanding how each business activity contributes to the overall value delivered to the customer and identifying areas of improvement for achieving competitive advantage. This framework was particularly useful for dissecting the organization's operations into primary and support activities, thereby illuminating areas ripe for digital enhancement.
Following the adoption of the Value Chain Analysis, the organization undertook several steps to implement the framework effectively:
- Deconstructed the organization's operations into primary activities such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service, as well as support activities like procurement, technology development, human resource management, and firm infrastructure.
- Assessed each activity for potential digital transformation opportunities, prioritizing those with the highest impact on customer value and operational efficiency.
- Implemented digital tools and platforms in identified key areas, starting with operations and marketing and sales, to streamline processes and enhance the customer online experience.

The Digital Capability Maturity Model (DCMM) was also deployed to assess and develop the organization's digital transformation maturity. This model helped in benchmarking the organization's current digital capabilities against industry standards and creating a roadmap for digital maturity. The process involved:
- Evaluating the current level of digital capabilities across the organization using the DCMM's five maturity levels: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimizing.
- Identifying gaps in digital capabilities and formulating strategic initiatives to elevate the organization to the next maturity level.
- Implementing targeted digital initiatives, including the development of an e-commerce platform and the integration of digital marketing strategies, to progress through the maturity levels.

Omnichannel Retail Strategy Development

For the development of an Omnichannel Retail Strategy, the organization utilized the Customer Journey Mapping framework. This approach allowed the team to visualize the entire customer journey across multiple touchpoints and channels, identifying areas where the customer experience could be enhanced. Customer Journey Mapping proved invaluable for understanding the complexities of customer interactions with the brand, both online and offline, and for designing a seamless, integrated shopping experience.
As part of the Customer Journey Mapping process, the organization:
- Mapped out all existing customer touchpoints across in-store, online, and mobile channels, highlighting moments of friction and opportunities for engagement enhancement.
- Developed targeted strategies for each identified touchpoint to ensure consistency and continuity in the customer experience, leveraging data analytics for personalized customer interactions.
- Implemented technology solutions, such as integrated CRM systems and mobile apps, to facilitate a smooth transition between channels for customers, ensuring a unified brand experience.

Additionally, the organization applied the Service Blueprint framework to meticulously plan and execute the omnichannel strategy. This framework detailed the operational processes behind each customer touchpoint, ensuring that the backend operations supported a seamless front-end customer experience. The implementation involved:
- Identifying key customer actions, frontstage (customer-facing) interactions, and backstage (internal) processes for each touchpoint within the omnichannel strategy.
- Aligning internal processes and training employees to deliver a consistent and cohesive customer experience across all channels.
- Integrating feedback loops into each touchpoint to continuously refine and improve the customer journey based on real customer data and insights.

The results of the business process re-engineering initiative indicate a successful stride towards digital transformation and operational efficiency. The 15% increase in online sales and the significant rise in customer engagement metrics underscore the effectiveness of the digital and omnichannel strategies in addressing the challenges of declining foot traffic and sales. The reduction in operational costs by 8% further validates the positive impact of streamlining operations through digital tools. However, while these results are promising, the initiative fell short in fully capitalizing on the potential for market share growth, as indicated by the moderate improvement in customer satisfaction scores. This suggests that while the omnichannel strategy enhanced the customer experience, there may have been missed opportunities in fully integrating and optimizing all customer touchpoints. Additionally, the increase in employee efficiency and morale points to a successful organizational restructuring, yet the long-term sustainability of these changes requires ongoing attention.
Given the mixed results, the next steps should focus on deepening the omnichannel integration to capture and leverage customer data more effectively across all touchpoints. This could involve investing in advanced analytics and AI to personalize the customer experience further and predict buying patterns. Additionally, expanding the digital marketing strategy to include emerging platforms and technologies could enhance online engagement and attract a broader customer base. Finally, sustaining the agile organizational structure through continuous training and development will be crucial in maintaining operational efficiency and employee morale. These recommendations aim to build on the current successes while addressing areas for improvement, positioning the organization for long-term growth in the competitive sustainable fashion market.
