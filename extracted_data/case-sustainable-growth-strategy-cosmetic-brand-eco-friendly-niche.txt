Source: https://flevy.com/topic/cost-management/case-sustainable-growth-strategy-cosmetic-brand-eco-friendly-niche




Consider this scenario: A leading eco-friendly cosmetics brand faces challenges in cost management amidst a highly competitive market.
With a 20% increase in production costs and a 15% decline in market share over the past two years, external pressures from rising raw material costs and aggressive pricing strategies by competitors are intensifying. Internally, inefficiencies in supply chain management and a lack of economies of scale are exacerbating cost issues. The primary strategic objective of the organization is to achieve sustainable growth through improved cost management, market share recovery, and reinforcement of its eco-friendly brand identity.
This organization, despite pioneering in the eco-friendly cosmetics space, is encountering stagnation due to escalating production costs and a diminishing ability to compete on price without sacrificing its sustainability principles. These challenges suggest that issues may stem from an over-reliance on a limited number of suppliers for sustainable raw materials and a failure to fully leverage digital marketing channels to engage with a broader customer base.

Cost Management through Supply Chain Optimization

The organization applied the Resource-Based View (RBV) framework to its supply chain optimization initiative. The RBV framework posits that firms can achieve a competitive advantage by effectively managing their internal resources and capabilities. This approach was particularly useful for identifying unique resources within the supply chain that could be optimized to reduce costs without compromising on sustainability commitments. Following this framework, the team executed the following steps:
- Conducted an internal audit to identify key resources and capabilities within the supply chain that provided competitive advantage or could be enhanced for greater efficiency.
- Assessed the sustainability and cost implications of these key resources and capabilities to determine areas for optimization.
- Implemented targeted improvements in logistics and supplier relations to leverage these resources more effectively, reducing overall supply chain costs.

The organization also utilized the Theory of Constraints (TOC) to further drive its cost management efforts. The TOC is a management paradigm that focuses on identifying and managing the most significant limiting factor (i.e., constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal. For the supply chain optimization initiative, this meant identifying the most critical bottlenecks that increased costs or reduced efficiency. The process involved:
- Mapping out the entire supply chain to pinpoint stages that were the most significant bottlenecks to cost efficiency.
- Developing targeted strategies to alleviate these bottlenecks, such as adopting just-in-time inventory management for certain raw materials.
- Monitoring changes in supply chain performance to ensure that the identified constraints were effectively addressed and did not shift to other areas of the supply chain.

Through the application of the RBV framework and TOC, the organization successfully optimized its supply chain, leading to a 15% reduction in overall production costs. This not only improved the company's cost competitiveness but also reinforced its commitment to sustainability by enhancing efficiency across its supply chain operations.

Brand Reinforcement through Digital Marketing

In the initiative to reinforce the brand through digital marketing, the organization employed the Consumer Decision Journey (CDJ) model. The CDJ model offers a comprehensive understanding of how consumers interact with brands from initial consideration to purchase, emphasizing the importance of digital touchpoints. This model was instrumental in mapping out the consumer's path to purchase and identifying key digital channels for engagement. The implementation process included:
- Mapping the consumer decision journey for the brand’s target market to identify critical digital touchpoints for engagement.
- Developing targeted digital marketing campaigns tailored to consumers at different stages of their decision journey.
- Measuring the impact of these campaigns on consumer engagement and conversion rates to refine and optimize digital marketing efforts.

Additionally, the organization applied the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) concept to prioritize marketing efforts and resource allocation. Understanding the CLV helped in identifying the most valuable customer segments and tailoring digital marketing strategies to these segments. The steps taken were:
- Calculating the CLV for different customer segments based on historical purchase data and engagement metrics.
- Allocating marketing resources more efficiently by focusing on high-CLV segments with personalized marketing campaigns.
- Tracking changes in CLV over time to assess the effectiveness of targeted digital marketing efforts and adjust strategies accordingly.

The strategic application of the Consumer Decision Journey model and Customer Lifetime Value concept led to a 10% increase in market share. This success was attributed to more effective engagement with consumers at critical touchpoints and the optimization of marketing resources towards high-value customer segments.

Product Innovation and Diversification

For the product innovation and diversification initiative, the organization leveraged the Kano Model to prioritize features and innovations that would delight customers and differentiate the brand in the eco-friendly cosmetics market. The Kano Model categorizes product features into must-haves, performance attributes, and delighters, based on how they influence customer satisfaction. This framework proved invaluable for identifying features that could set the brand's new products apart from competitors. The team implemented the framework through:
- Surveying existing and potential customers to understand their needs and how different product features could meet these needs or exceed expectations.
- Identifying a set of 'delighter' features that were unique to the market and aligned with the brand’s sustainability values.
- Incorporating these features into the new product development process to ensure that the final products not only met but exceeded customer expectations.

The organization also applied the Diffusion of Innovations theory to strategize the market introduction of its new products. This theory helps in understanding how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technology spread. By identifying key adopter categories (innovators, early adopters, etc.), the organization could tailor its launch strategies to accelerate adoption. The process included:
- Segmenting the target market according to the Diffusion of Innovations adopter categories.
- Designing a phased product launch that targeted innovators and early adopters first to build momentum.
- Utilizing feedback from early adopters to refine the product and marketing strategies for broader market segments.
